# Getting and Cleaning Data
Part of the course on Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data by John Hopkins University
## Project 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

### Data description
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

### Requirements
Create one R script called "run_analysis.R" that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Outcome
This project resulted the following outcome:
1. a tidy data set called "[my_tidy_data.txt](https://github.com/Velhorst/GetAndCleanDataProject/blob/master/my_tidy_data.txt)", derived on the original data
2. An R-script called "[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/Velhorst/GetAndCleanDataProject/blob/master/run_analysis.R)" for the creation of the tidy data set.
3. a code book called "[CodeBook.md](https://github.com/Velhorst/GetAndCleanDataProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md)" that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that are performed to clean up the data
